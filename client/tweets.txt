@Ted_Underwood @ClaudeWillan Yeah, good point: the idea that popular culture drowns out genuine art is hard to take seriously when you have all of the internet in front of you. Almost like the better model for aesthetics today is not aesthetics but porn: what you watch is just your kink, between you and you.
@ClaudeWillan Watch opera, or The Bachelorette? Either way you're just gonna stream it. So why should anyone care what you watch? You didn't "go" to the opera, you just changed a little parameter in some vast database so that you got stream A not B. That sameness erodes logic of 'distinction'.
@ClaudeWillan but not due to the 'omnivore hypothesis' (whereby the true mark of distinction is to appreciate all culture from high to low brow), so much as the annihilation of distinction itself in the giant digital soup‚Äîwhere no one media is any more/less reproducible or accessible en masse.
@ClaudeWillan Hm, not sure. By 'resistance' I just meant 'recoiling' or 'repressing', more of an aesthetic than a political response. But I think the cultural subject position defined in opposition to mass culture (itself also a politics?) is obsolete. I guess I'm saying Bourdieu is dead, +
Resistance to popular music (Taylor Swift, etc) is culturally obsolete. It's no longer possible to 'counter' culture as 'bad' or aesthetically impoverished: music is good, TV is good, the internet is funny, and we're all just hooked up to the same cultural 'streams' and 'feeds'.
The truth is all those guys *want* to be cancelled, shit I get it, it's the only way to feel alive anymore
Having a hard time remembering which of my friends lurk-reads my tweets, who's off twitter, etc. Never quite know whether I can reuse in conversation some already-tweeted material ...
'Self care' feels so perverse as a term because it takes what is fundamentally a social relation‚Äîcare‚Äîand introverts it into some over-biologized self relation (skin 'care', etc). Commodifying care into consumption, it's now the bourgeois mind that 'cares' for the bourgeois body.
Went swimming in the Cam yesterday. It was so hot (33C/92F), finally a proper summer day. Felt baptized, refreshed. But couldn't shake the sense that that very moment was the peak of the year -- from here on out it's back down into the jaws of hell, breakouts, and quarantines...

Suddenly globalization feels extremely weird. Before 2020, on any given day in most places on the planet, (esp. in hypercenters like NYC, etc), people from all over the world were congregated there, daily jumbling together the entire planet's germs, daily passing them on again...
Remember when Trump threatened to send federal troops into states and we were like, "whew! good thing he's not allowed to do that!"‚Äîand then weeks later federal officers were shooting from trenches in an ongoing nightly war in Portland? Anyway, good thing he can't delay election.

@npseaver Isn't this partly there in the transition from Wiener's 1948 'Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and Machine' to his 1950 'Human Use of Human Beings: Cybernetics and Society'?
The lines to break them up on are already there, just covered up: Amazon is both the infrastructure connecting all businesses &amp; consumers, while at the same time competing with those businesses‚Äîusing its omnipotent money and omniscient data like God 'competing' with Adam &amp; Eve.
This Bezos-Cook-Zuckerberg-Pichai hearing is interesting because Dems &amp; Reps are taking turns beating the CEOs up rather than one party sweet-talking the witness and apologizing for the other, as with the Barr hearing yesterday. Both parties worried Big Tech stifles 'competition'
It's weird how little it feels like there's a presidential election campaign going on
I wonder if part of what made cybernetics attractive to scientists and philosophers in the 50s and 60s was that its concept of the 'feedback loop' provided a more positivist, mechanical version of 'the dialectic' -- a version that rationalized 'negation' into 'negative feedback'.

@pfessenbecker But, fwiw, I like Br*enig. A clever millennial Catholic socialist woman, she's an interesting voice. I also think she represents a quadrant (socially conservative, economically liberal) which I think we may be repressing because we all secretly want it, a socialist domesticity.
@pfessenbecker I mean, that version you just laid out would be, but there may be other ways to do this. I agree that socialists can't keep pretending to critique 2-party system while playing nice within it. What may make more sense, *because* it doesn't make sense, would be to run Republican.

@cejarvis It's pretty thick in the movie and in 80s cartoons. The Autobots are semi-trucks, classic cars, hotrods, doing honest work in a capitalist society, whereas the Decepticons are all fighter jets and tanks, wasting their resources on war obsessions, while not free in their society.
@cejarvis I mean, going back to the Cold War allegory in the first cartoon movie of 1986, the Decepticons were probably mostly Stalinists but there were definitely at least a few Trotskyists in there. Starscream was always trying to betray Megatron, e.g. But the Autobots were Reaganites.
you know the Autobots would've voted for Trump

@dan_sinykin @Ted_Underwood That's my general sense too. I mean, that's a pretty seismic shift for the discipline, whatever its meaning.

@dan_sinykin Yeah. Which is another reason it'd be interesting to see more diffuse The_Donald-like conversations going on across twitter...
@dan_sinykin There's reddit (e.g. /r/The_Donald) for tuning into various community discourses, I do that sometimes. But I never really understand reddit, and I'm not sure it has as much of an effect on the total social discourse. But maybe I'm just biased to twitter since I use it more...

@SethRudy A landslide would be nice. But if I were in voting in CA I would write in Bernie. Trump already lost popular vote by 3 million in 2016, imagine what it'll be in 2020. The problem is the electoral college. There's 0% chance California would give its electoral votes to Trump anyway
@SethRudy I'm not interested atm in what this fact might be used to justify, just with the fact itself: Bernie would have won easy. Even M4A passed easy.  Personally, yes, I'll vote for Biden in NC out of desperate, base, utilitarian need. But I'd encourage deep-blue state voters not to.
Trump is going to lose big in November, which means Bernie would have won easy, and all that neurotic, embarrassing handwringing about 'electability' was for nothing -- less than nothing, delaying and hindering the real revolution.

@scott_bot @Ted_Underwood @yoavgo @clured I regret saying 'AGI'.

That we then turn to algorithmic/computationalist solutions only proves the point.
@Ted_Underwood @yoavgo @clured But logic is part of language understanding and creation? And is this the language model that was also auto-generating code? People are obviously hoping that ML will lead to 'AGI' in sense that one model to rule them all. Ofc we can build logic+math subsystems, that's not new rt?

Seeking epistemic refuge in autofiction is how you end up with an incestuous novel like "Topeka School", where Lerner pathetically &amp; boyishly narrates not only his own insipid childhood in all its technicality, but also the intellectual-heroic tale of ... his own father.
@benlibman Yes! At same time, our abdication of the affordances of fiction is what seems to connects our tastes in both autofiction &amp; historical fiction: in both, we're getting more than just story &amp; literature, we're getting something useful. We're doing real Work! not just playing around.

More controversially, I think what you can see from that vantage point of contradiction is the limits of personification as the basis for political struggle. In fact, no one sits completely outside the system, no one has a pure vantage point of critique. We are all compromised.
As a straightish white cis dude it can be tempting to find some form of oppression you experience so as not to personify the very structures of power you want to undo. But we need to resist that temptation. Don't fight the contradiction, don't try to 'repent'. There's no way out.

@ncecire Really?? I suspected as much. Uh oh, my niece isn't going to take this well...
@drjameswood Yeah I can see how TERF could emerge from 2nd-vs-3rd wave feminist debates? And that men may just have more generalized transphobia (2 genders! etc). Just wondering if there were a specific form of transphobia based on claims to some kind of essentialized (cis) male experience.
Unfortunately my 3yo niece is still not convinced we need to defund Paw Patrol and that Chase, like all cops, is a bastard. I'll keep on her though
Is there a TERF equivalent for men? (i.e. a cis-male discourse specifically dedicated to excluding trans men as men)? Probably, I'm just not aware of it...

@b_cavello I guess I don't feel the need to choose or come up with a word to explain my experiences, which I feel like can speak for themselves well enough. But if words help others, power to them :)
@b_cavello True, I can understand that: thanks for saying this. Personally, I'm sometimes attracted to men, more often to women, ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but the term 'bisexual' has felt insincere, and for me (a white cis dude), too problematic a political temptation to claim a subaltern status I don't rly have.
On the other hand, it's true that terms &amp; concepts help make sense of aspects of our experience. And maybe we're just not there yet to a world in which sexuality can remain fluid &amp; undefined. But at least to me that seems closer to Utopia than dividing out our sexual 'identities'
No judgment! Just, to me, if there's one thing that would seem to defy rational categories, it would be sexuality, a deeply pre-rational and phenomenal experience that needs no other descriptor than what it already is moment to moment. Like, just do what you want, be free
@sdanielm Yeah, I read somewhre that uni's are basically slumlords and get a huge part of their income from charging students rent. So I get why it makes sense financially, but it's just so dangerous to public health. And I have zero sympathy for places like Cambridge with huge endowments.
Is it bad that I agree with this? I understand sexuality has a politics to it, and people feel proud of their identity, but isn't sexuality a fluid performance that is stifled and boxed by micro-categories? Hasn't this kind of categorical thinking been well critiqued by the left? https://t.co/4eICx0xBWe

Trump's "fascism" isn't really nationalist or territorial; the absolutism is really just the blind egocentricity of capitalist fantasy. It's materially structured narcissism. He simply doesn't understand why he shouldn't just be able to do or buy or spin or say whatever he wants.

You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to think it's a bit of a coincidence that SARS-CoV-2 first broke out in Wuhan, which happens to house Wuhan Institute of Virology, which diplomatic cables happen to show US "officials were worried about safety and management weaknesses".
@Ted_Underwood Yeah in the 90s there was a Deleuzian + cybernetic engagement with these things, when digital network culture was still coming together and its pieces still disjointed: Usenet (which forbid commercial content), early Internet and "hypertext(uality!)", the arrival of the .com, etc
It's a shame that 'virality' is stuck as a biz school concept, since it does point to something distinctive about late digital capitalism -- a global network which encourages &amp; profits from sudden contamination -- but there's not really an adequate leftist or Marxist equivalent.

The same industrialist tendency toward Toyotism -- whereby workers stand apart from the production process, its 'autonomation' or partial self-regulation reducing them to the machines' manangers -- is inside AI, as programmers turn into managers of autonomated learning algorithms
Interesting how labor's production is increasingly dematerialized -- dislocated from space, dispersed across digital networks, etc -- even as labor's *reproduction* (domestic work, childcare, etc) is *re*-materialized in cottage-like homes, subsistence-focused, sewing masks, etc.
@DanAShore "nearly" being the operative word here
@clured @Ted_Underwood @dan_sinykin Last thought, a brief Treppenwitz: If not 'black box', then, perhaps we ought to call advanced ML/neural nets a 'gray box'. In principle understandable, but in practice barely possible. Also: 'close reading' neurons? The same problems of interpretation recur as we unpack the box.
@PetrosAposto Yep! https://t.co/XZHf082IUS
Even if secondary tho, 'automation' -- seen more broadly as capital's 'machinic drive' (Dyer-Witheford), its rising 'technical composition' of tech/machines/algorithms to humans -- still seems important part of how rural/industr. labor is reterritorialized into informal services?
(https://t.co/RaOvFVm5UH &amp; https://t.co/XZHf07L7wi)
Just read @abenanav's two brilliant articles in NLR on automation and the future of work, which show how it's not automation but global industrial overproduction which has led to underdemand for labor. Also shows how this leads not to rising un- but *under*employment, in services
@Ted_Underwood @dan_sinykin @clured That's true. We do learn something about words &amp; contexts. But we'd be crazy to rest content with sheer distributionalism as our linguistics. Our whole understanding of contextual word mushes is informed by syntactic theory: of noun compounds, phrases, prepositions, clauses, etc.
@Ted_Underwood @dan_sinykin I guess I'm not sure if that last sentence is true. Reminds me of something @clured once said: that as our computation becomes more neural, complex, and self-organizing, by the time an AGI is born, we'll have no idea how it happened: more like biological birth than human design.
@Ted_Underwood @dan_sinykin Isn't it true though that ML models are growing in complexity and difficulty to understand? They're usually optimized for accuracy, and operate according to hidden layers of neurons or some other abstract representation. How many parameters does GPT-3 have again? It's monstrous.
@dan_sinykin @Ted_Underwood The political cost of this approach is that we effectively limit potential forms of computation to reproducing existing patterns. Thus ML "bias": it's not that the programmers are designing racist algorithms, but that the ML algorithms can't help but reproducing racist input data
@dan_sinykin @Ted_Underwood If ML is powerful enough to infer higher-order patterns through the sheer scale of its training data on lower-order input, we effectively automate the cognitive labor of designing and programming explanatory models (like generative syntax in linguistics) of higher-order patterns.
@dan_sinykin @Ted_Underwood Underlying this for me too is a Marxy worry that the sudden conquest of computation by brute-force, black-box machine learning will lead to a new level of abstraction and alienation in our cybercapitalism. Soon, we won't even need domain-specific programmers anymore. All hail ML!
@Ted_Underwood @dan_sinykin Also, if the conclusion is that words are powerful--strong signals of textual specificity--then that's an empowering finding: it confirms the need for disciplines that study the power of words. But we need words + syntax for a full model. Just as both nodes &amp; edges in a network.
@Ted_Underwood Sufficient identification (using machine learning on atomistic, low-level features) is not sufficient explanation (the abstraction, reconstruction and rearrangement of low-level features into a model of how the entire phenomenon under analysis works and functions).
@Ted_Underwood That doesn't mean these word count models are sufficient as a model of literary textuality or history: of either our literary pleasure, or the complex patterns (syntactic, narratological, rhythmic, etc) which make essential parts of our concepts of genres &amp; historical categories.
@Ted_Underwood For sure. And interesting to re-approach Q's of formalism and stylistics via Q's about word counts. We've talked about latter before. In general I think we've seen how word counts are sufficient to reproduce basically all of our generic and literary-historical distinctions. But +
@Ted_Underwood Did we ever really leave that consensus, though? Formalism of one kind or another has maybe always been a part of literary criticism, rhetorical analysis, and hermeneutics. I think in retrospect the supposed anti-formalisms of the 80s-early 2000s prob exaggerated their departure.
@Ted_Underwood As for literary 'pleasure', which is more distant from literary meaning and semantics, it seems undeniably true that artful syntax, structure, and form are a key part of why we enjoy reading literature. A neat, crisp Austen sentence; a precise, but complexly-tissued Jamesian; etc
@Ted_Underwood Don't understand the meaning of whether or not specific brain regions dedicated to syntax as opposed to semantics. But in terms of lit crit: wasn't Fishian critique of stylistics simply that syntax wasn't directly semantic, but only became so under different interpretive models?

On that model, there's no accumulation. Each month, everyone pays something &amp; gets something back, no matter how small. The amount paid is always the same: 1% your discretionary budget. The amount paid back changes: a % of the total fund which is inverse to % of fund you donated.
Ok, here's my cyber-Proudhon crowdfunding app idea: The People's Fund. You join by paying each month 1% your monthly discretionary budget (post tax, rent, food etc). The raised money is then just redistributed back to donors in reverse order, by a "last shall be first" principle.

@kevin_modestino I'm not actually sure to be honest. Attaching here one of my favorite tweets from this week. Maybe that's kind of what I mean.

@Ted_Underwood @cwellmon Obv the actual web of vulnerability isn't new, but viscerally feeling it with Covid, to the point that it becomes almost a new global phenomenology: that's new. Maybe part of what feels exciting rn is that from the streets is also emerging a genuinely new experience of solidarity
@Ted_Underwood @cwellmon I felt it first with Covid, though. A planetary catastrophe in which suddenly all of our lives are materially but invisibly connected in a single global web of vulnerability? Like the World War, but moreso? That's new to me
@kevin_modestino Yeah, basically I guess that's it in a nutshell, ha.
@Ted_Underwood @cwellmon I also feel like the best of twitter could be thought in terms of Action, i.e. what one does before one's peers in a way which is allowed to characterize one to the community, potentially forever in social memory. But there's something new to "wartime" mind. Never felt it before.
@Ted_Underwood @cwellmon (Yes! 1sec) Also, given that these protests are in part motivated by 20% unemployment from Covid and government's horrendous, life-destroying response, our wartime response to Covid feels continuous with the wartime collectivity on the streets and its broad multiracial solidarity
@cwellmon @Ted_Underwood I guess so. But feels strange to call our instinctive, "wartime" collectivity around Covid -- quarantine shaming, behavior enforcing, etc -- "politics". That and the thought-realignments happening now are mediated so much by social media, too, in a way not captured by "politics"?

@cwellmon @sivavaid Cool. Sends me every time that Amazon is Democrats' most trusted institution. What kind of knowledge-trust is that? Trust in the knowledge economy?
There's value to leftist 'groupthink' in times like this -- which shouldn't come as a surprise, after we just group-thought our response to Covid in a vacuum of centralized leadership. The collective-psychological 'battlespace' of The Narrative is important, esp in internet age.
@cwellmon This breaks down by politics too, with (not surprisingly) the police near the top for Repubs. Near the middle for Dems, next to unions and philanthropists (which seems low to me, actually: but this is after Feguson; and obv higher % of Dems are Af Am/POC)  https://t.co/VEuAQQGlua

And, just as they safely work from home, now the PMC watches the protests from afar, letting the working class fight for them rather than putting their bodies on the line beside them. They contribute to the cause only financially, like PACs, pretending money is political speech.
These class divisions have now become biologized as the PMC works from the safety of their homes, sipping coffee in their socks, while the working class is either unemployed or risking their life everyday keeping society afloat. Shame on us for not prioritizing the working class.
Looking back it rly was the professional-managerial class's refusal to build a coalition with the working class, partly over aesthetic reasons (ppl being "mean" online!), that doomed us to the choice Cornel West described in 2016: "neoliberal disaster or neofascist catastrophe?"

@SethRudy At least it would‚Äôve been a political possibility. I already blame voters. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll ever forgive Democrats that voted for the apologists of capitalism, who espoused the very policies which are the cause of our many crises. In some ways we have only ourselves to blame.
@SethRudy I don‚Äôt know! That‚Äôs the point. The normal political process has excluded these possibilities for the foreseeable future. The attempted socialist takeover of the Democratic Party, which would‚Äôve brought about these changes, was crushed by its neoliberal wing &amp; rejected by its PMC
@SethRudy Universal health care, especially during a pandemic which has left 40 mil Americans jobless; a Green New Deal to address unemployment and the ongoing climate crisis; abolition of ICE and the demilitarization and defunding of police forces; withdrawal of troops; outlawing PACs; ..
The central &amp; obvious critique of electoral action is not that voting is ineffective but that the scope of its effectiveness is pre-constrained to exclude the very actions we need to take. We‚Äôre faced with an illusion of choice perpetuated by the ruling class &amp; liberal ideology.
Neither of our political parties represents the working class or black &amp; brown Americans. No elected Democratic leader at any level of government has taken real steps to redress this crisis. Both parties represent the ruling class, an essential tool of which is the police state.

Simple! :)
@Ted_Underwood @hkpmw @JaimieMurdock There comes a time when solidarity with one's political party violates a deeper solidarity we ought to have with our neighbors, fellow countrymen, and the people of the world -- esp those ppl acutely suffering, like black and brown Americans. The Dem party has failed them &amp; us.
@Ted_Underwood @hkpmw @JaimieMurdock Yes I am so excited to act in solidarity with my political party: I get to vote during a pandemic for the guy who will leave 15 million ppl w/o health insurance, and during a nationwide crisis of police brutalizing black Americans, for the architect of mass black incarceration...
@Ted_Underwood @hkpmw @JaimieMurdock We shouldn't tell people what to do but I do think we should be attempting to overcome our position as individuals and act instead as neighborhoods, cities, and states. That's what the streets offer, imo. That's what the urgency of revolution offers. Everything else kicks the can
@Ted_Underwood @hkpmw @JaimieMurdock We need a variety of responses, but to imagine that folks just responding however they feel (change from inside or outside? be on the streets or donate? whichever!) is somehow, like an invisible hand, going to lead to systemic change, has not panned out and it probably never will
@Ted_Underwood @hkpmw @JaimieMurdock Fair enough. I suppose this is true, and is useful as a position we can all meet at in the end. But for that very reason it inspires no immediate action. If change always 'takes both sides', what do we do right now in the midst of this crisis? Acute pain calls for acute response!
@Ted_Underwood @hkpmw @JaimieMurdock Why is revolution so hard for us Americans to imagine? We think it's eminently possible in still more brutally oppressive nations, and even a necessary step for them toward democracy. But not in our own? Why can't we have our own Tahrir Square? The nation and world are burning...
@Ted_Underwood @hkpmw @JaimieMurdock Well, the thing about revolutions is they happen suddenly and infrequently, while reform is something that needs constant pressure. How is that opposition 'false'? We're either in the streets or we're not-- in which case we wait years to vote and along the way hope things change.
@hkpmw @JaimieMurdock @Ted_Underwood ?? I haven't "made up my mind about you", what does that even mean. I don't understand where these ad-hominem flourishes in your tweets are coming from. I haven't found a list comparing B's and W's exact suggested policies to redress police brutality, if you have one please send.
@JaimieMurdock @hkpmw @Ted_Underwood I think Warren should stick to her principles and continue to advocate ("nag" prob bit sexist) for universal health care during a global pandemic which has left 40 million Americans jobless while trapped inside a health care system in which you must have a job to have healthcare.
@hkpmw @JaimieMurdock @Ted_Underwood The difference between Bernie's and Warren's politics is vastly more than aesthetic. Feels like projection: The strange strategy of Warren supporters was to insist B and W had the same substantive politics so that differences were merely aesthetic. W's flipflops proved otherwise.
@Ted_Underwood @hkpmw @JaimieMurdock Basically you're asking: Reform or Revolution? But how is that a serious question anymore in June 2020? When's the last time 'campaign finance reform' was even heard aloud? We have crises upon crises upon crises. How is 'iterative change' a viable way to save the nation &amp; planet?
@hkpmw @JaimieMurdock @Ted_Underwood https://t.co/y36Ey5VcsA
@hkpmw @JaimieMurdock @Ted_Underwood https://t.co/dMswVw54ep
@hkpmw @JaimieMurdock @Ted_Underwood I'm not identifying Bernie and the protests, that's silly, I'm saying that direct action and electoral socialism are the only viable paths forward for substantive change. As for whether Bernie supports the protests more than Warren, I leave it to you to deccide (close reading!):
@JaimieMurdock @hkpmw @Ted_Underwood I don't want to get into a Warren argument because I'll be here all day. But yeah, I don't think someone that is willing to drop universal health care, the signature position of the progressive movement, *during a pandemic* can be a viable or trustworthy force for change, sorry.
@hkpmw @JaimieMurdock @Ted_Underwood Ofc the repeal of the VRA was a catastrophe. Who's arguing otherwise? I can recommend ppl working toward that end: (1) the people in the streets; and (2) electorally, socialists, like Bernie, whom many academics repudiated in favor of a candidate now sucking up to be Biden's VP.
@hkpmw @JaimieMurdock @Ted_Underwood Sure, but isn't that inseparable from other forms of corruption, like SuperPACs ensuring the candidates which succeed won't endanger the position of the ruling class? Republicans suppress the black vote; Democrats take it for granted. Do either actually represent black interests?
@POrg @cejarvis @Ted_Underwood I understand. I feel the same way. I would humbly suggest however that the best use for that fury is to break some windows and fight the state alongside your neighbors. You're probably doing that already, but imo that (and not tweeting, voting, whatever) is what matters most now.
@hkpmw @Ted_Underwood But the real issue is that Obama has no analysis of the corruption in the electoral process. Bernie's win would have been an electoral revolution. It was brewing. But then in one fell swoop, partly motivated by Obama's own prodding, the corporate-funded establishment thwarted it.
@hkpmw @Ted_Underwood Everything we know about Obama suggests that he really does think violence is illegitimate political speech. He writes that protests are for 'raising awareness' but voting is what really changes things. Someone trapped in an ICE detention center we might break open would disagree
@POrg @cejarvis @Ted_Underwood Well tbf I wasn't really trying to accurately portray yours or anyone's position, but rather a liberal climate of belief in which voting is held up as the (or 'a', whatever) solution to our problems, without reckoning with the rot within the electoral system which got us here.
@POrg @cejarvis @Ted_Underwood Sorry to subtweet that, yeah, but I'm also responding to calls from many people to redirect our raw political energies on the street into the ballot box, as if the only options that await us there aren't neoliberal capitalists and former architects of mass black incarceration.
@Ted_Underwood As if George Floyd wouldn't have been killed under an HRC presidency; as if the police wouldn't have responded in the identical way to the protests that broke out. Voting is important, but the ruling class wants you to believe that it has more political agency than it does.
@Ted_Underwood Exhibit A:  https://t.co/PlezomjZ3v
@JaimieMurdock @POrg I took that statistic from here: https://t.co/14DyYovRNC, which is admittedly from 2017. The Washington Post has a database of police shootings (https://t.co/51ypvIZVyd), but I don't know if it tracks police sentencings.
@Ted_Underwood No, but Obama's "don't boo; vote!" does. That isn't just him, too: it sums up the liberal ideology that voting is the most substantive form of political action we have, while shouting and rioting and burning and breaking are powerless and illegitimate forms of political speech.
@POrg @scott_bot Burn police stations. Break open ICE detention centers. Occupy Capitol buildings around the country and demand that every single police force be demilitarized and defunded.
@Ted_Underwood I see a lot of liberals telling people to vote (4 months from now, 2 years from now, 4 years from now...) as a response to our acute trauma and crises. That's absolutely a faith in our electoral institutions. I also see liberals saying "no stop, 'violence' is counterproductive."
@POrg @scott_bot I'm not objecting to voting but its liberal doxa, exemplified by Obama's finger-wagging response to our problems: 'Don't boo, vote!' The ideal outcome of an election is only as good as its best candidate. 2020's best Presiden. outcome is the architect of mass black incarceration!
@POrg @scott_bot Yes, we need to vote. I vote in my local elections and research the candidates. And yes, obv the Trump admin has made things worse. But as we've seen over the last few days, there isn't a single city, Democrat-run or Republican, which does not have an abusive, militarized police.
What will it take to convince liberals that simply voting for Democrats is not going to save us?
@scott_bot @POrg Voting is obviously important but there comes a time that our faith in it devolves into privileged naivete. Belief in the normal functioning of representative democracy in what is obviously a failed police state is exactly the kind of ideology we need to dismantle and radicalize.
@scott_bot @POrg I hope so too. But de Blasio was considered most progressive mayor of NYC. Look at his response. The Minneapolis mayor, a young Democrat, repeats lines about outside agitators coming straight from his police dept. No local leader has fired any police chief despite days of abuses.
@POrg BLM began in 2014 with a black, Democrat President &amp; AG. Since then only one cop is serving jail time for killing a black man. We should all ofc vote but voting clearly isn't an adequate response to this crisis. Neither Democrats nor Republicans are willing to confront the police

@nbbauch It's complicated. Undercover cops really do infilitrate protests. Antifa &amp; white anarchists really do get triggerhappy on even local biz windows. But ultimately the violence is inseparable from the protest, which must constitute some kind of threat in order to be taken seriously.
RT @BigMeanInternet : Liberals have found their angle and it's that the protests they agree with were legitimate and the violence and destruction they can't countenance is part of a plot by anarchists/Nazis/Russians to discredit the liberal protests.

Like an overzealous immune system, we're decimating whole substrates of the social network to fight this thing,  but we also need those systems we destroy to recover. How are people going to find jobs, date, get surprised by things, if they never encounter anyone they don't know?
Isn't "social distancing" effectively obliterating the "weak ties" (acquantainces, friends of friends), which Granovetter famously showed actually present us with more jobs, dating partners, new info, etc than our "strong ties" (close friends who know same ppl/think same way) do?
Wow we're really just going to forgive "If you don't vote for me you ain't black" ?

@LKonstan @adamkotsko @joncgoodwin Same. It's, uh, *meta* work ...!
@LKonstan @adamkotsko @joncgoodwin I do like going back to the everything-is-customizable lifestyle. And it's great for programming. But it's still a time sink, you end up googling how to do so many things. Apps are ok. LibreOffice isn't so bad. And Scrivener 2 works great with the Wine adaptor. So, so far so good
@LKonstan @adamkotsko @joncgoodwin Totally. Had to retire the 2013 Macbook Pro, which needed to blast its fans 24/7 and would randomly die. Got a mini fanless desktop instead. 8 CPUs, 32GB ram. Running ElementaryOS which is very pretty and has better screen management than Mac (side-by-side apps, 2+ desktops, etc) https://t.co/pZGUhBY2U8
@LKonstan @adamkotsko @joncgoodwin I see. I'm asking these ?'s too recently. Just switched back to Linux, first time since 2007. Experience much smoother and prettier now. But surprised 13 years didn't bring more. I guess geeks' free time still can't put out the socially necessary labor time to compete with Mac OS
@LKonstan @adamkotsko @joncgoodwin I think PF has text preview, a console, etc, as sub-panes. But maybe not an inbuilt text editor? I see what you mean though...
@adamkotsko @LKonstan @joncgoodwin "Path Finder" (https://t.co/HctE999UTR) is pretty cool for this reason. It's a 2-pane finder system (throwback to "File Commander") which makes so much more sense for moving files around. And it has nice tab/window support. I use it a lot but occasionally regress back to Finder.
@paul_barrett In general, I do think people care about writers' parents' careers. It's usually on their wikipedia and often reveals a lot. But I agree, the sudden resurrection and weaponization of all this is totally cynical, envious, &amp; prob misogynist. Maybe I shouldn't be amplifying it.
@paul_barrett I don't think it's relevant in any major way. It certainly doesn't invalidate or overturn her writing. But I do think it's fair for us to want to know things about the writers we read, incl. their backgrounds. It provies social context. Perhaps especially to a personal essayist.
In @playbookplus today: "The biggest donors to Joe Biden's super PAC are Anita and Joshua Bekenstine. Joshua is a managing partner at Bain &amp; Co." Good to know Romney &amp; Biden support the same ppl &amp; interests. Biden's basically Republican and libs are like, vote blue no matter who!
@bernardionysius Totally fine and normal? Especially if industry is involved. Honorariums for invited talks are semi-common in US at least. I guess in the Zoom age it might feel a bit weirder but I'd take the money and run.
Confused by the Tolentino discourse today. Yes, it's gross to try to cancel JT for this. But it's entirely possible that her parents really were exploiting vulnerable people for their own gain. Why should we dismiss that just because JT told us her parents told her it's false?
Remember in March when we were all like: hmmm, should thousands of us still fly from around the world to Chicago to hold a four day conference in a single hotel?ü§£
@Lenora_DW Totally agree, and that story really sums it up. It's almost as if we're complicit in our own casualization, happy to act as autonomous, productivity-oriented culture workers, but forgetting that our self-autonomization leaves us all alone against material reality of institutions
RT @Lenora_DW : @quadrismegistus After that all we talked about was word count, hours spent writing, etcetera. In the absence of academic labor solidarity, emphasizing productivity becomes a way of deflecting blame away from universities onto individual graduate students. And it follows us into the p&amp;t process.
@John_ReganRHUL lol. alas, what can I say, my hashtag game is poor and my emoji skills still ameteur
You ask an academic, "how are you" and they just tell you about their recent productivity levels.
Academics are the worst at this. We all think we're radical critical leftists or whatever but really we've swallowed more capitalist kool-aid than almost everyone else I know.
Why are folks so into self-"improvement", always optimizing their work habits and productivity and exercise and blah blah blah. Let's extract as much surplus value from our labor as we can! Or we could chill out, just let it flow, &amp; not let Capitalism get so far up in our brains?

@Ben_P_Carver Woah! This is incredible, thanks
@evankindley No, thanks! Will check it out. I'm new to thinking about this topic so it's esp helpful. I've just been thinking about it ever since the Ygl*sias-style liberal critique consolidated against the "conspiracy theory" of Bernie supporters that a Democratic 'establishment' even exists
@V21collective no! Both this and @Jodi7768's book "Aliens in America" look perfect -- thanks, will definitely check them out. The latter will be especially fun to read as someone whose brother is really deep into the online UFO conspiracy world... üôÉ
I want to write a defense of conspiracy theories, or at least a critique of their liberal critique. Sure, they've been weaponized by the right. But simply to insist on some shared social order of facts and common sense is to miss the rot in that social order which they diagnose.

@scottenderle @Ted_Underwood @chan_plan Yeah, this align-as-you-go method seems to produce much clearer results than the post-hoc Procrustes alignment. You also get a single vector space out of it at the end across all word_decades, instead of just pairwise alignments.
@scottenderle @Ted_Underwood @chan_plan Experimenting w/ this. This partic one is many models over time, but each model for decade t+1 has its vector model initialized by one already-trained for decade t (Yoon Kim et al 2014, https://t.co/X5JxsAhxhx).

@Ted_Underwood "Industry" is also collectivized (not one's industriousness), neutralized and made analytic -- even as work is newly abstract and positive (and postindustrial?). All sorts of words though Williams/Koselleck argue change in C18, but no nice corpus equivalent to COHA on C19-C20...
@AlexWermerColan "Virus" wasn't frequent enough to show up in that data, but "disease" is attached--interestingly may not be best captured by these semantic changes/vectors but by -- scientization?

@pfessenbecker That makes me feel better, and I might ask you what company you recommend. But I'm still a little concerned... is it a good idea right now for a few thousand people from across the world to descend onto a single hotel in Chicago?
RT @LukewSavage : I mean, it‚Äôs now quite literally Bernie or bust
And tell me how Warren isn't effectively part of this centrist coordination, taking money from a super PAC after running out money and after promising she never would. What is the point of that except to keep her campaign sputtering on along enough to undercut Bernie's chances?
fuuuuuuuuck Klobuchar dropping too and immediately appearing with Biden at a rally? tell me how the centrists aren't coordinating and tell me how it isn't a catastrophe and a shame that progressives aren't.
Right now I am scheduled to fly from the UK to Chicago in late March for ACLA. But if I were to come down with the coronavirus, I will not have US health insurance and will be unable to go to the hospital without going into serious debt. I'm not sure whether I should go anymore.
Was touched by the Benedicite canticle in matins, which calls on the concrete things of the world to "praise and magnify him"‚Äîas if praying for a wounded, dispirited God, who needs support from his own creation.

RT @gnrosenberg : When I hear liberals who don't disagree with anything Sanders says claim, nevertheless, that he is "too liberal to be elected" they are talking about their internalized shame about their own political failures and, indeed, the overwhelming failure of that generation of leftists.
The centrists are coordinating while the progressives are digging their heels. Warren needs to drop and endorse ASAP. Leftists gotta stick together! https://t.co/3nyygOSLI4
@scott_bot Fair enough, the electoral college is also not democratic, but if current polling numbers hold, Warren will have millions of fewer individual votes than the leading candidate. No matter what, then, it's hard to make a democratic case for a last minute delegate break to Warren.
@machawk1 @priscillamc @DrexelCCI Also: hi @priscillamc! :)
@scott_bot I agree it isn't a good strategy, nor is it a democratic one. Warren isn't projected to win a single state. Whatever one's opinions about superdelegates, for the DNC to somehow bypass the will of every state in the union to nominate her is an unconscionable goal for progressives.
@machawk1 @priscillamc @DrexelCCI Congrats! Quite the trajectory! For me, after graduating UF in '08 I stayed in the California Bay Area for 11 years, grad school off and on; finally finished my PhD in 2019 and am now a postdoc in the UK. After FL and CA I'm now living through the first real winter of my life! :P
fwiw I respect the decision to vote what you believe no matter what. I'm just puzzled why Warreners don't articulate their support in those terms and instead repeat the managerial language of how Warren will "get things done" as president‚Äîwhile knowing she won't be president.
Warren supporters often describe themselves as pragmatic, seeing through the idealistic promises of Bernie, and yet are idealistically throwing away their vote to someone who has no path to the nomination rather than pragmatically supporting the only viable progressive candidate.
RT @DrJillStein : A few weeks ago Warren said she'd never accept Super PAC money. Now she's got the biggest Super PAC after Trump. This is a stunning reversal from someone who - up until recently - regularly denounced dark money and corruption in politics. After this, how can anyone trust Warren? https://t.co/1KnnWWLgBX
@machawk1 @priscillamc Haha omg yes! Long time no talk! How are things? You‚Äôre based in PA now?
If Americans don‚Äôt have free health care by the time 60-80% of the world‚Äôs population gets coronavirus then tens of thousands more people will die than would otherwise and many more will go into debt. No clearer reason than to vote for the most stalwart candidate on health care.

Progressives need to stick together when the time comes. And that time may come sooner than expected if the DNC is planning to stage a coup unless Bernie wins an outright majority of delegates. https://t.co/zLx2Ru2azP

@NanetteRissler Yeah. :-/ I use the same Eng-lang abs/conc words, and measure them in translations of the text. The #'s are stable across diff translations, which is something. But really the handful of world lit is there for incidental reasons: like Balzac vs. Flaubert for history of realism.

@kevin_modestino Right. The most significant millennial responses were collective: Occupy and Black Lives Matter were mass social movements predicated on an internet-inspired collectivism. If Occupy famously "had no demands," maybe it was waiting for its own ideological theorization in socialism.
@kevin_modestino I think that's exactly right. They've also inherited a political discourse which has (esp. in universities and the internet) already theorized and normalized identity formations like queerness, transness, and POCness, but which didn't actually better their *material* prospects.
One thing I don't fully understand about Bernie's appeal is how, in a way, *post*-millennial it is. Gen Z is his stronger base (+54% to +33% in NV), and seems much more excited about collectivized identity via socialism than the individualized identity politics of millennialism.

The fact that there's widespread belief that Bloomberg can beat Trump, but doubts persist that Bernie can (despite his being the national frontrunner by 10 points), is symptomatic of how under "capitalist realism" we believe that only money, not people, have agency.

@Ted_Underwood By "take no prisoners" I mean that I hope he *doesn't* unite the wings of the party. Trump didn't unite Republicans at the RNC, he just took the party over. Similarly, I hope democratic socialism takes over the Democratic Party, not compromise with it. This is revolution! :)
@Ted_Underwood I dunno, I think this whole "average American voter" mind-reading that we all keep doing is fooling us more than anything. Word "ideology" or no, people can tell when principles get mushy, like when Warren backed off from M4A. And I hope Bernie takes no prisoners in the DNC.
Maybe Warren couldn't unite the socialist left with the neoliberal center because people accurately perceived that these are contradictory ideologies?
"Defeating Donald Trump" is empty of ideological content. It's neither a meaningful nor an inspiring political commitment. HRC proved the politics of "defeating Trump" doesn't defeat Trump; the only thing that will is actually captivating people with a real political imagination.

@Ted_Underwood Liberals have also mainly restricted their political agency to voting in midterms and the presidential election, so it makes sense to me that the stakes are high right now and that the best shot we have at fundamental change is a candidate with a fundamentally different ideology.

@warwicksmith @shnelbis1 My guess is that it's the explicit social analysis in the dialogue. Dialogue tends to be more abstract than narration‚ÄîI'm still working on separating the two registers out.

@JWGrieve Yes, though to a limited extent. I run word2vec models decade-by-decade on Chadwyck-Healey, ECCO, and the British Periodicals Online corpora, and then take the median value for each word along the Abstract&lt;&gt;Concrete vector (itself generated with different sets of "seed" words).
@jchrisrobinson A lot of non-English fiction is missing: I mainly added Balzac, Zola, and Flaubert because they're constantly cited in debates about the development of realism and naturalism (eg Lukacs' "Narrate or Describe" etc). I have to work with translations, so there's a risk there too...

The left never adequately resisted the concept of a "terrorist", whose only real meaning is a person one can kill with impunity, someone for whom the law doesn't apply. It's a neo "homo sacer"‚Äîsomeone (in Roman law) exiled with a sacred curse who may be killed by anybody.

@Confessant I'm not sure. I do think true counter-ness involves transgression to some degre. Or if it doesn't, maybe it should, in order to give real, causal substance to the threat it poses. (e.g. Just as windows ought to be broken at a protest, to make the threat of the populace real).
@B_C_Richardson @DawnRayd hell yeah
The left needs to find a way to re-occupy the *counter*-cultural space as well, rather than cede it to the new camp culture of the alt-right. It's aesthetically boring to insist we're the sane ones. Bernie-ism is the closest thing we have to an edge, which is a little pathetic.
@LKonstan I guess so. Maybe to postindustrial capitalism, which just gobbles up the labor-time it saves through automation to extract more surplus value. But one can imagine a postindustrial "socialism" in which automation makes things cheaper while services become more accessible.
Ironic that in our late-capitalist service-based economy, what gets more expensive are basic human services (health, education, childcare, etc), while what gets cheaper are fetishized tangible commodities like TVs, toys, cars, clothes, etc. https://t.co/HX8ZCUCDTP

Interesting how "Difficulty" replaces academic notions of value as rooted in knowledge, with capitalist concepts of value as rooted in labor-time. Stanford students routinely spoke this way.

We're striking Monday. Why can't we do this in the US!?
@JohnPatLeary @Ted_Underwood Obviously the goal is organizing. But to echo @johannawinant, I routinely meet tenured academics who know "it's bad" but not that it's *collapsed.* There's a persistent sense that if you're good enough, you'll get a job‚Äîa meritocratic lie that prohibits cross-rank solidarity.

@JohnPatLeary @Ted_Underwood Lastly, greater transparency leads (hopefully) to greater solidarity‚Äîforcing a broader awareness and deeper urgency, which can in turn help foster broader and more effective actions against these trends incl. the casualization of labor and the neoliberalization of the university.
@JohnPatLeary @Ted_Underwood I also think that this example of the "didn't we already know that", common to DH work, is an especially palpable one for how data helps us better *see* and *feel* trends‚Äîhere, perhaps especially for academics not on the market who aren't personally faced with it year after year.
@JohnPatLeary @Ted_Underwood Not really. We have a general sense that "things are bad," but we only have a vague idea *how* bad, and most importantly for which subfields more than others. That gender/ethnic studies is bucking trend also points to how more critique and decolonization efforts might help us all
@Ted_Underwood Whether we need to collect every job to do that? I'm not sure. It does seem as if job posting practices are fragmenting, the usual timelines are loosening; and through all these changes we still need to see where we're headed and why. But how best to do that, I don't know...
@Ted_Underwood You might be right. I do think the greater timeliness, the extra granularity (subfields, etc), does make crunching these numbers worth it over and above just waiting for the MLA reports on the JIL. Sub-trends like persistence of gender/ethnic studies help us see what's happening.
@jeduardogonz I know @joncgoodwin has worked with the old MLA JIL's (https://t.co/jUKiflO3Gh), based on OCR'd copies made by @ridolfoj. Jon and Jim if you're listening, would love to hear your thoughts about how we might best gather structured data from them (school, job title, job desc, etc).
@jeduardogonz Yep! They're PDFs, and the formatting changes, so it wouldn't be easy to gather the info, but we could crowdsource it. And then, starting around 1999, there's at least transcribed text (not just images), so in principle we could try to automate the process for most of the 2000s.

The labor theory of value also helps us understand how grossly inhuman a billion dollars is. If someone earns $100K a year for their labor, then a billion dollars will buy you 10,000 person-years of that labor -- roughly twice the length of recorded human history.
Reading Smith now who honestly is even clearer about the labor theory of value than Marx. The real value of a commodity is the labor you save in not producing it yourself. In purchasing a commodity you therefore purchase or "command" a certain quantity of labor. Money buys labor.
This is from "The Current Crisis and the Anachronism of Value: A Marxian Reading" (https://t.co/mmh9rkkiZe), which I think is a decent summary of his major theses in _Time, Labor, and Social Domination_ (1993).

@artjomshl @Ted_Underwood @_akpiper Even more relevant though is @Ted_Underwood's work on the changing markers of prestige in poetry: increasingly, words predicting prestige are negative or dark in valence.

@artjomshl @Ted_Underwood Interesting article!

@pfessenbecker No not at all: I only meant to say that sexual expression may be classed in the eyes of a professional culture, in such a way that partly explains its repression. But you're right that this is all very complicated, especially when workplace harassment is a very real problem.
@pfessenbecker Yeah, I wonder if it's really just professional culture more broadly‚Äîas if having a sexuality itself is unprofessional. It's as if the Professional-Managerial Class needs to repress its own sexuality in order to distinguish itself from working-class passions and social relations.
I should probably delete this tweet.

There‚Äôs so much whataboutism and zero-sum ethical thinking on twitter. But (a) two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right, as my mother used to say, and (b) isn‚Äôt such a quantitative approach to value just capitalist pseudo-logic? Justice can‚Äôt be ranked or sorted or made to add up to zero.
@JonathaNgrams Absolutely! But there's def a case to be made that the *nature* of labor has been transformed in post-Fordist societies. People have written about cognitive capitalism (Boutang), immaterial labor (Lazzarato), digital labor (Fuchs), etc, which I think gets lost in "industrialism."
There's interesting talk about AI, big data, and machine learning as a new "Industrial Revolution." But the mechanical, manufacturing imaginary of "industrialism" seems in some ways to obscure the radical changes to value and the labor process posed by such a digital revolution.

I need to go back to Williams' Country and the City to think about this more, but I wonder if the left today is too preoccupied with an ultimately urban class imaginary‚Äîworking class vs. PMC, e.g.‚Äîforgetting that the *spaces* of class may be more determinative than its functions.
Country vs. City seems in the end far more meaningful than North vs. South, Coasts vs. Heartland. Having just driven across the U.S., I was thinking about this: you see Trump bumper stickers, even Confederate flags, as soon as you leave the city‚Äîany city, not just in the South.

@hralperta @JobMarketSuppo1 Great idea, will do! The whole motivation here of course is to create more transparency about the market, so an accessible and durable place to put all this information would be really helpful.
Lastly, I had to aggregate/standardize some of the subfield names, some of which changed name on the wiki midway through this period. These name changes are reflected here: https://t.co/BWAz8nUN90
Disclaimers: Who knows to what extent these trends reflect changes in wiki usage, or changes in the number of jobs. I suspect that rises in 2011-2014 reflects rise in usage of wiki and standardization of formats, but I could be wrong. The data could also be refined more manually.

Socialist arguments for seizing the means of production are more persuasive when broken down by industry:  - Nationalize utility companies b/c they are public infrastructure.  - Nationalize health insurance b/c the profit motive works against the imperatives of a healthy society.
Rather than fix its crumbling infrastructure, which started wildfires last year, PG&amp;E, the utility company with a monopoly on the Bay Area, is forcing 2.5 million people to go without power for up to 5 days.  No better example that all utility companies should be nationalized.

@V21collective As the discipline sinks, nostalgia for aesthetic judgment is just more violins. In my opinion the only viable direction to take is exactly the opposite: Abandon aesthetics *even more*, and become the profession which studies Language In The Wild for cultural history and critique.
@V21collective Maybe I'm cynical, but I just don't believe this (would be the outcome), and I even have a hard time believing people believe it. Discourses of aesthetic greatness, human flourishing, liberal arts, etc etc, already proliferate in the discipline. Literally no one cares but us.
The debate about whether literary critics can call things Good or not is so facile and so obviously a displacement of our real anxieties as a profession

@Ted_Underwood @LKonstan @alexisgallagher I just still don't understand why the global stakes of films has to imply the *total* absence of sexuality. Another trend which may be related is the new emphasis on martial virtue: disturbing valorizations of noble suicide in Star Wars, dying for noble cause in Blade Runner, etc
@Ted_Underwood @LKonstan @alexisgallagher I guess then the comic book/superhero narrative form was a perfect match for the increasingly global distribution model of blockbuster films: not only safe for kids, but the fate of the world (all audiences) is at stake, which is threatened and saved by powerful feats of CGI.
@Ted_Underwood @alexisgallagher Yeah. And maybe is this why the big screen is more desexualized than streaming TV, whose more fluid and networked distribution model awards niche and kink and selective audiences. Still: why isn't there at least sexual *tension* in these films? Something else is going on too imo.
RT @Ted_Underwood : Latest (beautiful but knife-twisty) quit lit piece makes me think that literary studies really needs brutal honesty from a wider range of perspectives. We seem to be teaching people to rhapsodize about the emperor‚Äôs new clothes right up till the moment they leave.
It‚Äôs as if analytic philosophy is predicated on the total exclusion of anything resembling a dialectical thought.
The Freudian regression to presexuality in these movies is symptomatic of the broader regression of sensibility they represent, a turn from human stories of human sexuality to superhuman pornographies of power.
Truly striking how thoroughly desexualized action movies are today. Where's the sex in Marvel movies? In the new Star Wars movies? Not a peep of sexual tension anywhere. Even when it is there (Hulk and Scarlet Johansson? Rei and Finn?) it's sublimated into romance or friendship.

@Ted_Underwood True, but didn't we also put more faith in those consequences than we knew all along it really deserved? (thus why a Mueller prayer candle is funny?) Mueller fetish was at least in part a disavowal of the harder work of taking responsibility for Trump and fighting back ourselves.
@Ted_Underwood The Mueller probe certainly did good work. But it was obviously also overdetermined, a projection of quasi-religious levels of blind liberal faith. (For his bday I got my brother a prayer candle of St Robert Mueller!) It's def time to move on and make something new politically.
@jdporterlive It would absolutely hurt. Impeaching Trump just for symbolic effect feeds right into the witch hunt narrative, which was already strengthened by the finding of no conclusion. A far sadder irony than Comey's help in electing Trump is the Mueller report's help in his re-election.
@jdporterlive How is that a real strategy when it is guaranteed to fail?
I was as much a Russiagate addict as the next heartbroken liberal, but at this point I think clinging to the Mueller report is only going to hurt us. The obvious psychoanalytic reading is that all along this was about our own denial and inability to make a real political strategy

@jeddobson There's definitely a risk. Exploratory DH work requires a careful accounting of which method and which epistemology is active at any given moment. This carefulness is itself a kind of rigor, which I think was part of Lauren's point: that "rigor" in DH is much more than statistics
I'll add that I think Da misunderstands this tension because, as @Mark_A_H points out, she goes after only hypothesis testing work, ignoring the (much larger!) body of DH work doing Exploratory Data Analysis that stages a contrapuntal movement between modes and objects of reading
I like Lauren's response here pushing back on Da's bizarre insistence that we not apply computational methods beyond their intended (scientific/corporate) use.

@teddyroland @Ted_Underwood Still, for me, it at least reinforces the idea that operationalizing aspects of literary form (rhyme, meter, etc) can in fact produce more informative features than word frequencies. Models of formal features can also reveal formal rather than 'linguistic' outliers and edge-cases
@teddyroland @Ted_Underwood I should say I don't really think this dis/proves anything, per se. I would have guessed that word frequencies do poorly to classify sonnets written 1600-2000 in comparison to poetic features. I suspect wordfreqs work better for longer texts, and for fuzzier categories like genre
I should note that this is a micro-experiment inspired by a fascinating twitter discussion (https://t.co/3TCfIWzqMm), begun by @teddyroland, about the strengths and limitations of word frequencies as the sole input features to computational models of texts.
@erinroseglass @jdporterlive It's a Python script that @jdporterlive, I, and others at Stanford have been developing for years. More information on its github (https://t.co/HYNyOWgTXM), but basically estimates a poem's line length and stanzaic form, metrical form, and rhyme scheme.
@teddyroland So I couldn't help myself and I ran an experiment about this: https://t.co/hXplg6aDaG  Turns out poetic features better predict sonnets. The code is on the github and is highly replicable if anyone wants to throw other featuresets or classifiers at the data  (attn @Ted_Underwood)
What's a sonnet to a machine by any other name? Which textual features best predict whether 14 lines of verse is a sonnet? Word frequencies, or poetic forms (rhyme, meter, line length)? Answer: Poetic forms. Notes and code: https://t.co/jWyrOTP8gd (collab work with @jdporterlive) https://t.co/phxtmK9NIU
@peligrietzer @ClaudeWillan No one knows, as far as I know. Such dramatic suspense! https://t.co/i5K1SNBuDe
@peligrietzer @ClaudeWillan Hey! Nice to meet you. Thanks for the introduction Claude-- now I'm curious, walking back through memories of tymes past... Well: to reenchantment! üçª
@Ted_Underwood @teddyroland I could also see that being a description. Hoo boy! description, explanation, identification, interpretation... I need to brush up on my philosophy of (social?) science! It's always been funny to me how DH stumbles onto all these difficult phil-of-science questions in new ways.
@Ted_Underwood @teddyroland Or your work showing that the vertical axis of literary prestige recapitulates the horizontal axis of literary change: IMO that does a lot of work to explain prestige as deeply related to the overcoming of pastness and pass√©-ness. If not proven, that explanation becomes available
@Ted_Underwood @teddyroland But explanation is still the holy grail of knowledge, at least for me. It may be impossible in toto, but something like Jim English's work noting that since the 70s prestige novels have increasingly been set historically does do some work to 'explain' prestige at a given moment.
@Ted_Underwood @teddyroland That seems right, which is why unigram modeling works best (IMO) with genre and other fuzzy categories, and worst with poetic forms like the sonnet. And often we do only want to identify something, not "explain" it, so that we can trace its history, esp of fuzzy things like genre
@Ted_Underwood @teddyroland But the sonnet example itself is not a hill I want to die on. The broader point is that identification (which unigrams and classification do so well), although useful and important, is not *explanation*, for which we need to go deeper and model the relevant processes and forms.
@Ted_Underwood @teddyroland How adequate our beliefs are to reality is precisely the question! e.g. Generative metricists know what "iambic pentameter" is. But they've worked since the 70s to model and understand its grammar: which phonological patterns (stress, weight, syllabic structure) are permissible?
@teddyroland No knock on unigrams or classification: these have impressive and important applications, and probably do get us 80% of the way toward where we want to go. But for me that missing 20% is not just missing accuracy, but missing ways of knowing and modeling literary form.
@teddyroland e.g. We might be able to classify sonnets according to their unigram/word frequencies, but how much would that tell us about what really makes a sonnet a sonnet: that it has 14 lines, normally iambic pentameter, and follows a specific rhyme pattern?
@teddyroland This makes sense to me: texts are made of words, so the phenomena that interest us about texts are probably tied enough to word patterns that we can estimate those phenomena based just on the words. At the same time, that estimation can work only indirectly, almost accidentally.

@brisvegas1 @scott_bot Fascinating! Thanks for sharing, I had never heard of this. I'd love to compare these contemporary but robust vectors against the ones I've generated from historical but messy data.
@benmschmidt I've also got a jupyter notebook here (https://t.co/yhodYKQg3z), a long &amp; messy log of notes and code that got me here. Still newish to logistic regression, so if you do take a look and spot anything, let me know. The relevant functions are "classify" &amp; "classify_from_crosstabs".
@benmschmidt It's predicting whether a noun is an object or a human, given how often it instantiates the 2000 most frequent SyntacticRelation_Words, like "dobj_taste" (meaning, noun X was object of "taste"). I use a leave-one-out cross-val to check model and then infer probs for unknown words https://t.co/EWcRptFkzw
@brisvegas1 @scott_bot Not yet! though I'm happy to answer Qs. It's for my dissertation, which I'm rushing to complete at the moment, though I do hope to find a time to write up a blog post about this sooner or later!
@Ted_Underwood No you're right, that's really interesting. I suspect that abstractions that are 'inhuman' in the C18 (like "joy," "care" "praise") got that way because they were often objects‚Äîone can "taste" joy (n=15 in 1700-25), "sing" praise, etc. Maybe that kind of objecthood winnows away?
@Fykomfei Yeah, it's a very tricky question. A word can function more or less abstractly in different contexts and periods (Raymond Williams is really good at showing this for words like "culture," etc). I've tried to come at this question computationally elsewhere: https://t.co/TiIioYINaW
h/t to methods developed by @Ted_Underwood, @dbamman, and Sabrina Lee in their article "The Transformation of Gender in English-Language Fiction" (https://t.co/USfmvyostj), which I've tried to adapt and rebuild for a human-vs-nonhuman context
For my chapter on personification, I'm exploring ways machine learning can help us trace the 'human likeness' of non-human nouns across history. Given only which verbs a noun like 'nation' is a subject or object of, how human-like does the noun appear to the model? https://t.co/AeTRhMOrjB

Someone needs to do a DH study of the language correlating with high ratio tweets.  Also: it's interesting how social media is itself already 'DH' in the sense that the 'ratio' quantifies or operationalizes, as a DH study might do, the bad-take-yness of a tweet. https://t.co/0Vv9JwQpFQ
@V21collective @Ted_Underwood A diagram of diachrony hypostatizes history into a shape, a form, which is neither past nor present, but outside the diachrony it reveals. (maybe?) This is why my favorite approaches to presentism, including V21's, explore this capacity of space to transmute time.
@V21collective ^ why I'm interested in the quasi-spatial approaches to history in @Ted_Underwood's work and other hyper-distant readings. A 4-century trend-line seems to exceed both historicism's obsession with contextualization and specificity and presentism's emphasis on now-ness and presence
@V21collective Maybe so, &amp; I'm probably being unfair to presentism, especially V21-style, strategic presentism. I just wonder whether the binary of present/past can be overcome more completely: I'm intrigued by how the transhistorical doesn't need "the present" as a tool or origin for analysis.
@RColesworthy @MichaelaWriting @Ted_Underwood Both models are v refreshing and I think we need more work like them! My tweet was really just a late-night brainflash about how the whole historicism-vs-presentism debate feels so dialectically blocked, and how the transhistorical may be just the key we need to get over it.
@RColesworthy Yep! I'm a big fan of @MichaelaWriting's work on the transhistorical as a relational framework among historical contexts. As a DHer I'm also interested in the transhistoricity of the trend-line, of time-become-space, which @Ted_Underwood's new DISTANT HORIZONS theorizes so well.
historicism vs. presentism badly needs some kind of sublation into an actual account of the transhistorical

Has anyone argued for a *Very* Long Eighteenth Century yet? Maybe 1603-1901, to start with the Jacobean and end with Victorian. It would emphasize C18's position as a hinge period between early and late modernity, and be a hat-tip to new distant histories digital and pedagogical.

@Ted_Underwood @DanAShore He def ended up with a Romantic definition! ("poetry is feeling confessing itself to itself" etc.) More broadly: I think it's good that we often make intensional, and not only extensional claims about literature: with "the lyric" as a concept or form, and not only a body of texts
@DanAShore I think it's tricky: "novel" could be a statement about all or most novels (generalization), or it could be a statement about novel-ness (abstraction). When Mill writes that "poetry" is overheard, does he mean that all/most poems are overheard, or is poem-ness language overheard?
@Ted_Underwood I really like this idea of the negative space of corpora, and I bet a DH attuned to that could go new places. For the Lukacs Q: for me, I'm not sure that Lukacs' "the novel", which indexes the loss of meaning's immanence in life, can be arrived at through any real generalizations
@KatherineBode Yeah, this is already complicated even before data gets thrown in! I wonder if a better place to go to to think about these questions is not DH but formalism, which today also seems to be trying to recuperate the *abstractness* of form: Levine's "abstract organizing principle" &amp;c
@DanAShore To say things about "the novel" might be to generalize about what most novels are like. But "the novel" might also be an abstraction like "the lyric," which seems less a generalization about most lyric poems than an attempt to articulate a lyric-*ness* as a form or quality.
RT @LKonstan : Working on a prospectus for a hypothetical scholarly project on the publishing industry, I have come to an important conclusion: When they merged, they really should have called themselves Random Penguin House. https://t.co/Y1AkIZZ0yf
Not a knock on DH or data, statistics, etc, which really do help us generalize about cultural history. But something feels unexamined in the transition from critical to quantitative language: a kind of slippage where abstractions (eg the novel) are assumed to be generalizations.
Common DH assumption I'm no longer sure of: when critics talk about "the novel," they really mean *novels*‚Äîthus we need data, statistics, etc. But "the novel" is obvi a complex term. It'd be silly e.g. to dis/prove Lukacs' "novel"‚Äîfor him the loss of immanent meaning!‚Äîvia novels.
@SethRudy Cowper?
@DanAShore @AaronRHanlon @Ted_Underwood @cwellmon It *is* the status quo in our research, except our research tends to shy away from longue duree arguments. But more importantly, in our teaching, we tend to center periodization over theme: esp. in "coverage" requirements, both in the curriculum and (relatedly) in the faculty.
@AaronRHanlon @Ted_Underwood @cwellmon @DanAShore Yes, exactly, this is what I'd like to see: a re-centering of big themes and ideas that have contemporary relevance and appeal, but presented and analyzed in their dialectical (historical, material, social, political, literary, etc) unfolding.
@cwellmon @Ted_Underwood @DanAShore @AaronRHanlon That said‚Äînow I'm a hypocrite, but‚Äîit strikes me that current disciplinary boundaries can only beg the question of what the future of the humanities could be. eg Kramnick's &amp; Nersessian's CritInq argument against interdisciplinary notions of "form" only begs the question of form.
@cwellmon @Ted_Underwood @DanAShore @AaronRHanlon Sure, but, how central to today's sociology is Weber's? Sincere question. My unfair caricature of social science is that its ambition to be a 'science' has brought with it bits of positivism, which make English's garden varieties of historical materialism harder to grow there...?
@Ted_Underwood @DanAShore @AaronRHanlon You know social science way better than I do, but, can you really get the same dialectical edge in sociology or anthropology? Maybe what I like about English is that (in our research at least) we get both history *and* theme: we "historicize" a theme, and see it in its unfolding.
@DanAShore @Ted_Underwood @AaronRHanlon My original reason would be gone, too‚ÄîI majored in English to assemble a sense of how literature and culture got to where I stood‚Äîbut reasons for doing things can (and maybe should) change. Tbh, I *keep* doing the humanities because I can't get its dialectical edge anywhere else.

Also, have to say, lately my feeling about the whole accusation that DH is complicit in the neoliberal university is: fine. If DH can help keep the humanities alive by demonstrating how it can train students to participate in the labor market, then, so be it. https://t.co/RyZXzKaiPW
I think the broader question here is how to sell Literature in today's labor market: e.g. Literature not as aesthetic richness, but as a complex form of language that presents more intricate challenges to CS, natural language processing, etc, than yesterday's Wall Street Journal. https://t.co/OHrY9GW5Mw
@abasu_ Yeah, good point. A truly balanced hybrid major would have to accommodate students coming from either end of the disciplinary divide, with very different backgrounds/proficiencies. I feel like this could be managed?‚Äîtracks? emphases? 2 versions of CS101?‚Äîbut challenging for sure.
@khetiwe24 @markhneedham @Mark_A_H @literarylab @neo4j Yeah, it was kind of experimental. We had a node in the graph DB for authors, texts, and words.

@friede @MaeveKane Wow. This all sounds like academic gerrymandering!
@friede Hm, here's where I realize that as a grad student I actually don't really know anything about the politics of majors, budgets, course availability, etc. Would love to hear more, though: how would it slash our budgets? I believe you, just don't follow.
@benmschmidt @KatherineBode Unionization. Cross-rank solidarity.  @goldstoneandrew wrote eloquently about this: https://t.co/gYVW3EsaK8  Also?: faculty covering each other's courses when on leave, instead of adjuncts = more need for profs. something I learned from @Devo3000's thread: https://t.co/AhUp7fIDm7
@benmschmidt @KatherineBode Maybe so. But I guess it's all related, too: if we could boost enrollments, we could save some jobs; if we could work collectively against adjunctification, we could save some jobs; etc. But you're right that limiting the number of PhDs helps contain the fallout on people's lives
@Ted_Underwood That sounds right. Stanford introduced a "CS+X" (CS + anything!) major a few years, to much fanfare. English got only one applicant. Why swap out useful CS courses? So we do need to theorize the relation to X: one *needs* an X, say, otherwise you have no real-world skillset, etc.
@benmschmidt @KatherineBode That's probably a needed adaptation. But I think the humanities crisis is broader than the jobs crisis, though maybe the latter is the most pressing part. I think we all prob want to preserve a world in which the humanities thrive, and so protect enrollments and programs also.
@Dorialexander You're right, "problem domain" is a weak descriptor for what I think the humanities does, does well, and could do more of if we had access to more students. Attention to detail, complexity, sources, origins, biases, etc‚Äîall part of the daily practice and ethics of the humanities.
Maybe that sounds like a cheap deal for the humanities, to be plundered for content, but it also puts the humanities in a position they love to be in: a position of critique, of nuance, of dialectical resistance to the easy scientism at the other end of the major‚Äîand university.
Pedagogy proposal: why not collaborate more with programs in statistics, computer science, etc, to create hybrid majors where science gets half the classes as a method, and humanities gets the other half as a problem domain: a space of questions, challenges, histories, cultures?
@KatherineBode you're probably right. I'd like to see us find a way to estimate how much change we need to make. The equivalent to climate modeling, measuring CO2 levels, etc. And if we need radical change, then let's think about it carefully and then do it.
@hkpmw Not a single one of God‚Äôs children should have to face my kitchen sink right now. It‚Äôs been, ah, Impossible for a while.
@KatherineBode Totally agree. And to keep having fun with the analogy: Just as we still drive cars that run on gasoline, we still live and breathe and rely on our disciplinary formations. We don't have to get rid of them: but we could at least make them hybrid or electric. adaptation helps.
@KatherineBode I agree it's hard to see the problem when we're all in different spots inside it.  About disciplinary formations being a blip in time: couldn't we say the same of the human being, though? Our species is a blip, sure, but, let's try not to be? Let's adapt, yes, but also reproduce?
The humanities crisis is the climate change of the academy: somehow we just can't seem to look it in the eye, take it seriously, and then work together to fix it.

@abasu_ beautiful! and perfect for what we're talking about
@abasu_ thinking or saying that is not‚Äîat least for me, and I suspect for others‚Äîa belief statement. it's a relaxing of the ego, a letting be, a psychological, affective event. it's also rhetorical, a mode of constructing an "I" in relation to a "Thou" that acknowledges limits to the "I"
@abasu_ really interesting about stoicism, Buddhism, Aurelius! what's funny, is this thought was brought on by wondering how to deal psychologically with the deeply intimate uncertainty of my future, being on the market. for me, the easiest, healthiest-feeling way? "It's up to God now."
@hkpmw cool! I wonder if evangelism here has a distinct stake in epistemology: it converts people with claims of knowing a transcendent truth. but I feel like in, say, catholicism it's more simply about the affective and psychological rhythms of mass every sunday, prayers every day, etc
it feels like it'd be more interestingly understood as a praxis -- a set of affective and social practices -- than as an epistemology.
in retrospect, not clear to me why christianity is so obsessed with epistemology: belief, faith, truth, etc.
@pgilbert142001 Consensus seems to be that there's not enough fingerprints for it to work, though. You have to know whose fingerprints to look for, which is one problem; another is that the op ed may have been co-written (by a speech writer, etc); another is that there may not be enough text :-/
@pgilbert142001 DH twitter is scrambling to figure out who the anonymous NYT op ed writer is, using authorship attribution algorithms that find an author's stylistic "fingerprint," and then look for those fingerprints in an anonymously-authored text. So: DH, unlikeliest of heroes, to the rescue!

We're all trapped inside the contradictions within the "Machiavellian Moment" (Pocock) of a capitalist republicanism.
The #lodestar crystallizes an ideological conflict deeper than left vs. right: it raises the question of whether a nation founded on civic republicanism can survive the late capitalist, amoral individualism of our culture, of which Trump is the perfect and inevitable embodiment.
Close reading of the #lodestar: - Lodestar is something that transcends you to which you submit for guidance. - In text, said to "restore *honor* to our public life": a sentiment of civic virtue. - Lodestar laments loss of civic virtue, to which the citizen of a republic submits.

@scottenderle @V21collective Yeah, I'm focusing on abstraction rather than generality. For "abstract words" I'm trying to stay close to Locke's "mixed modes" (justice, virtue, etc), i.e. words without any basis in substance; unlike his "complex ideas of substance", which can be more or less general/specific.
@scottenderle @V21collective ya what makes a word "abstract" is tricky, and definitely subject to historical change. which, DH-methods-wise, gets me into a pickle -- one I'm not sure I've solved, just thrown a bunch of differently-interpreted half-solutions at in an appeal to the "robustness" of the finding.

@anguishreid @V21collective wow, yes actually, good call! I only made it halfway thru "Intellectual and Manual Labor" before it got too trippy for me, but ya, I'm stealing from him and others (Adorno, Toscano, Ngai) the general framework of "real abstraction", abstractions made real through social praxis.
@bbenzon @V21collective Yes &amp; b/c the usual story about the rise of the novel is that the novel distances itself from the generalities and idealizations of romance (knights and princesses of virtue, fidelity, courage, etc) by developing a new concrete particularity in character, narration, &amp; description
@V21collective hypothesis is that abstract realism is a realism of the totality: abs. nouns (sense, taste, pride, etc) reify judgments, affects, and states into nouns whose impersonality lays claim to a reality independent of individuals, but through which individuals form a social totality.
@V21collective working through a counterintuitive DH finding that C18 novels often have more abstract words and fewer concrete ones than C17 romances. so, trying to pry apart realism from "concrete particularity" and think about how abstraction &amp; abs language creates its own kind of realism.
I'm writing about "abstract realism," but the room is crowded &amp; loud: I've found 121 other forms of "[adjective] + realism": 51 about literature (from "formal R." to "Kmart R.," "hysterical R." to "ecological R."); 31 in philosophy; 15 about art; 12 in political theory; &amp; 12 misc

@Ted_Underwood Cold War humanities were def a counterweight to science, but also a counterweight to technocracy and utilitarianism. It seems to me more the latter counterweight that's being overwhelmed, so that a 'scientific' humanities (= us now? a humanities open to DH?) would still decline.
@Ted_Underwood Though related, is there a slippage here between Science and Useful (esp. Monetizable) Knowledge? I'll bet if English departments taught students explicitly how to be Content Producers, enrollments would go up. It's prob less scientism than financial impact that's most relevant?
@Ted_Underwood Origins of the anti-scientific sentiment aside (in humanism + its critique), it feels to me a bit of a scapegoat for the humanities' decline. Aren't humanities simply trying to argue that other things besides Science are culturally important, too? (history? literature? critique?)

@Ted_Underwood @DanAShore This is not a critique of BoW models: they are really good at what they do, e.g. classification. For me, the value of "NLP" broadly conceived is how it challenges the researcher to build a model of literary textuality. Even that building process is a form of knowledge creation.
@Ted_Underwood @DanAShore Personally I do think CA should branch out more from BoW. Not to toot my/its horn but this is something I think the Lit Lab has always tried to do: from semantic fields, to syntactic forms of sentences, to thematic structure of paragraphs, to metrical structure in poetry, etc.

in C18, does 'the novel' as a category entail 'realism'? it seems to in Watt, and seems implied by C18 critics (Reeve, Johnson, etc), for the same reason: distinguishing the novel's realism from the idealism of romance. if so, when does the novel no longer entail realism?

@Ted_Underwood @scott_bot Totally! Makes sense. And I think, currently, CA (*humanities* CA) is enriched by its variety of epistemological/disciplinary commitments. I just hope that, no matter what, it somehow keeps alive its connection with humanities/literature departments. For both its sake and theirs.
Go see #SorryToBotherYou! It's mind-blowingly good. Like Get Out, it seems part of the New Black Gothic (https://t.co/XwtstXYdU0); but as a surrealist, allegorical satire, it also seems to reveal a related trend, a kind of new allegory, also seen in Get Out and This Is America.
Also, it should be noted that this kind of conceptual/critical work has long been practiced by scholars of race, gender, queer theory, disability studies, and other subfields (so it seems to me). I feel like I need to catch up and rethink my traditionally historicist training.
This might be a bit unfair. But I guess I'm just recapitulating V21's call for more abstraction/conceptualism, more presentism, more zooming out from historical minutiae to broader patterns. I can imagine classes on concepts like Values, Fake News, Social Networks, Populism, &amp;c..
@Ted_Underwood @scott_bot I hope you're right, but I'm not so sure: CA is a small (sub)field. There are only so many people, resources, journals (1?); there's no professional society, no yearly conference. It's a fragile quasi-institution that, like @scott_bot says, could legitimately take different paths
@cejarvis It def can be! But it's an acquired taste (it was for me at least), and one difficult for undergrads to acquire. (I think!) I also wonder if this difficulty is part of its value-logic: a mode of distinction, it might turn away students who aren't invested in that kind of capital.
I partly blame (new) historicism: if it rescued the field from some bad tendencies within postmodern theory, it also scrubbed classes of theory's conceptual sex appeal, shutting the windows to the outdoors and bringing in a boring Protestant work ethic of "the archive."
Still thinking about how English classes might appeal more to C21 students. I love this idea of a pedagogy analogous to SF, a genre which transgresses barriers of space (geography) and time (history) in order to stage a thought experiment. Why not teach classes that do the same? https://t.co/BuJu82RgxW
@scott_bot To me, it would be a tragic end to cultural analytics if it abandoned the humanities -- its concerns, its methods, its institutions, &amp; at their darkest hour -- to disappear instead into the big city of social sciences, where CA would probably end up being just a quirky wallflower

@Brett_Fujioka Maybe even moreso? AFAIK, the dual major program attracted very few students. That said, digital humanities (classes, Lab, etc) are a draw. They seem to appeal not only to Stanford's tech sensibility, but also as a means to do English outside the stale air of literary history.
Also, 2 things we associate with English studies seem increasingly illegible to students. (1) The value of studying history. What history? Kids are motivated by the present. (2) The value of cultural capital. What's that? It's so C20. High/low hardly applies to the internet age.
Granted, my program is pretty conservative in its classes and requirements. But I think the idea that students are dropping English for reasons of economic anxiety is probably self-serving. This is also our own failure of imagination, about what English studies is and can be.
Is there a survey out there asking why students are choosing not to major in English? A student told me recently that they're just not excited about studying the Western canon... and, like, what do you say to that? It's totally understandable, especially in the Trump era.

@bbenzon @Ted_Underwood @DanAShore Quant. crit. seems primed for dialectics by so often contradicting hermeneutic knowledge. It can help us "think against thought" (Jameson) &amp; find the way in which the *contradiction* e.g. between smooth and delimited, rather than one or the other, is the true historical process.
@bbenzon @Ted_Underwood @DanAShore The color analogy may be one solution. But I hope what I'm saying is not a plea for compromise. It's really coming from a new annoying habit of mine (I got from reading a lot of Jameson lately) to try to think more dialectically, and so to seek out contradiction, not compromise.+
@bbenzon @Ted_Underwood @DanAShore e.g. How can we maintain the contradiction between continuous historical change and historical periods, without trying to resolve it by rejecting the latter for the former? Seems to me that finding a way in which both are true would be the more significant form of new knowledge.
@bbenzon @Ted_Underwood @DanAShore Good point, and discussion. Lately, for me, DH's claim to disconfirm other knowledge doth perhaps protest too much. Is there a way of thinking about the rel. b/w DH &amp; "H" that maintains the contradiction between them, in order to sublate it into the way in which both are true?

@Ted_Underwood Talk of 'levels' seems part of modern scientific discourse, relating e.g. physics, chem, bio along a scale. But 'levels' often invoked to point out when they 'mirror' each other‚Äîfor Foucault, actually a pre/early modern discourse of similitude, of "as above, so below" thinking.
@Ted_Underwood Its over-confidence in discreteness is definitely one way the framework feels heavy-handed. But another: how it assumes a quantitative relationship between "levels", arranging them at intervals along a scale. Not intuitive to me why this 1-D relationality is necessary or desired.
the language of "levels" feels increasingly strange to me: e.g. 'on the sentence level', 'word level', 'mirrored on the level of form', etc. ...what is a "level"? I feel like the word compels us to take on premise some kind of food pyramid model of form and interpretation.

At the end of the novel, a playwright talks about her fear of "summing up": "Why go to the trouble to write a great long play about jealousy when 'jealousy' just about summed it up?" It's an ironic question, because this is what Outline does: it sums humans up; it outlines them.
This is probably just a projection but it feels to me that Cusk's "Outline" is also (in part) an "abstract realist" text. It subordinates showing to telling, the concrete to the abstract. Its stories are not so much mimetic expositions as distillations of experiences into ideas.
In my diss rn I‚Äôm writing about ‚Äúabstract realism‚Äù in C18 fiction (esp Haywood, Fielding, Austen). It's a realism not of mimesis, not a realistic presentation, but a presentation *of* the real: for them the reality of moral and psychological abstractions, of "virtue," "sense," &amp;c

Strikes me that Ted is working more than anyone else to theorize the new *digital* longue dur√©e, the meaning of a trans-century historicism-- which, as he suggests above, is dialectical, a history so historical that it in fact becomes a means of re-discovering the contemporary.
Hilarious, and poignant.

@DanAShore Haha, cool! I knew about the "clausulae" or Cicero's sentence endings, but didn't know about their parodies in the early modern period.
@fijimf Haha, not dumb. The crosses are authors I've marked as particularly famous or "canonical." I was trying to get their names to display more often, but couldn't figure out how to do it in Tableau.
@katyilonka The github (https://t.co/LiawCO00fA) lays out in much more detail the linguistics behind this. As for measuring when prose sounds good: who knows! :) In fact, traditionally it was thought that prose should *avoid* meter *in order* to sound good, so this data could read both ways.
@DanAShore because it's already known that verse tends to avoid metrical violations with special carefulness at the end of the line; and people like Saintsbury have argued that sentence endings in prose carry particular rhythmic effects. So ultimately I'd like to return to that approach.
@DanAShore Yes: it's just any random 5-word sequence in the text, verse or prose. In an earlier, more controlled version of this experiment on just a handful of texts, we took all 5-word slices beginning at the end of the sentence and moving backwards (throwing out remainder) +
@thelifeofwords Will do! Thanks for your comments-- these are exactly the kinds of questions we're trying to work through!
@thelifeofwords To be "metrical" is just to consistently alternate one's rhythm. If prose resists that kind of well-behaved alternation -- and it does -- its degree of resistance should exist on a continuum with that of various forms of verse and other kinds of language.
@thelifeofwords I agree it seems nonsensical to parse prose as if it were metrical, but we're hoping to test the limits of that intuition. +
@thelifeofwords "Rhythm" is a slippery and polysemous concept. But the "multilayered" concept of rhythm I was referring to above (which Prosodic does NOT yet capture) sees syllable stress, word stress, phrasal stress, emphatic stress, etc as all layers of stress adding up to an overall rhythm.
@thelifeofwords As I recall, Attridge's schema is still metrical in the sense that it's made up of alternating positions, beats and offbeats. Depending on the metrical constraints, Prosodic can capture Attridge's looser model of metrics (with empty weak beats, etc). +
@DanielGalef The parser doesn't assume a particular meter, but tries every possible sequence (or "meter") of alternating weak and strong syllables. So, not just wswswsws (for iambic), but also  wwswswws, etc. The only caveat is that the "w" and "s" must alternate at least every two syllables.
@thelifeofwords but ya, Prosodic is looking for meter, or for the *alternating-ness* of rhythm, rather than rhythm itself. So the meter it finds as the best fit for a phrase would be a bad representation of its actual rhythm, which, I agree, is much more nuanced and multi-layered and complex.
@thelifeofwords hm.. all Prosodic is doing is tokenizing and syllabifying the text, annotating phonological info like stress, etc; and then testing every possible metrical template (i.e those alternating b/w weak &amp; strong positions, each w/ 1-2 syllables) to find which best fits the phonology. +
@jamesscottbrown @Ted_Underwood Agh! You're right. Woops: I have this mixed up with his volume of (scientific) poetry, The Botanic Garden. No wonder it shows up as so unlike poetry. :)
@Ted_Underwood You're right! I was pleasantly surprised by that as well. Your tweet (and work on predictive modeling) inspired me to try to classify texts as poetry vs. fiction vs. non-fiction, based solely on these metrical features. Here's a graph showing the probability of being poetry. https://t.co/jEIqxKhL4K
@nmhouston A "line" is a random 5-word sequence, for both prose and verse. We're purposely ignoring verse lineation in order to ask whether, if you put a metrical stethoscope to texts in random places, you can hear the difference between verse and prose.
@joey_kuhn Not yet, but working on it! It'd be so great to see twentieth-century free verse and modernist fiction together.
@BEBischof @ahandvanish Nothing official so far! -- we're working on a paper for the moment. The best source now is the github page for the metrical parser we built: https://t.co/MwEgeXiQvn
What happens when you tell a computer to scan lines of poetry for their meter, except you sneak in lines of prose, too? You end up quantifying "anti-metricality," a text's resistance to scansion. This resistance, and the metrical distance between verse and prose, has a history. https://t.co/9z01VKovZT

@KareemHussam1 @MuhSabry Abstractness just means how similar a word is to a bunch of "abstract" words (like "injustice", "beauty") as compared to how similar it is to a bunch of "concrete" words (like "cows", "arm"). That similarity is calculated by the "word2vec" algorithm (see https://t.co/lvvk57RA9n).
@jackrusher I haven't published this exact thing, but it's of a piece with the posts, code, and data I have up at https://t.co/IR9gyK5py2 (this graph and the stuff there are all based on word2vec models of 18C literature).
@ottocrat I'd say they're both around the 0 line, as neither particularly virtuous nor vicious (i.e. the vector of moral value is orthogonal to them).
@Ds_Pol_As It's built on word2vec models -- https://t.co/BOHJD5BzDS -- of periodicals from 1700-1900. The x-axis is a vector pointing from a bunch of "vices" in the vector space to a bunch of "virtues." Then you can see where any other word is along that vector of moral value-- even "cows"!
@ramin__ It's built on word2vec models of periodical literature published 1700-1900. The x-axis is a vector pointing from a bunch of "vices" in the vector space (longer story how I got those) to a bunch of "virtues." Same goes for the y-axis, pointing from some concrete to abstract words.
As abstract words get more concrete (moving down on y-axis), the range of their moral value (along x-axis) narrows. https://t.co/kLRGoKSkUs
@jon_fitzgerald Interesting (and intuitive) to see that news articles are less emotionally volatile (lower variation) than the op-eds. I feel like we'd need more data to see if there's an historical trend. Also, is this just pieces on/mentioning Trump? If not, that'd maybe help focus the data.

@fubits Cool, thanks! I just made a github gist of the code I used to calculate semantic change: https://t.co/h6VLdri7HB. It's a gensim word2vec implementation of @williamleif et al's "local neighborhood measure" of semantic change that they propose here: https://t.co/Z68abZaCxr).
@epyllia @benmschmidt @williamleif I haven't blogged yet about measuring semantic change, but I'd like to soon. Hard to write about all this in tweets, obviously, but hopefully that made some amount of sense! :)
@epyllia @benmschmidt @williamleif In that paper they propose doing that by first getting all the neighbors of a given word in *both* models; then measuring how far that word is to all those neighbors in the first model, and then the second; and then comparing those distances, to see how much has changed.
@epyllia @benmschmidt To measure semantic shift, I use a method proposed by @williamleif et al (https://t.co/Z68abZaCxr) they call the "local neighborhood measure." The idea is to measure how much the "neighborhood" of a given word (i.e. its closest associations) has changed between two models.
@epyllia @benmschmidt So what that leaves is a new "vector" pointing (ideally) from "concreteness" to "abstractness," along which any other word can be oriented to measure its relative abstractness. (I talk more about that process here https://t.co/PsezdlTMfU).
@epyllia @benmschmidt To measure abstraction, word vectors let me *subtract* the associations of a bunch of concrete words from the assoc. of a bunch of abstract words (both hand-made lists). That then cancels out the assoc they share (noun-ness, etc) and leaves only their differences (=abstractness).
@epyllia (For more on that: I try to explain more about how word vectors work in https://t.co/GfUeoLQuAq, and why they're interesting in https://t.co/0daDpLeHoi. And @benmschmidt has a more thorough and interactive introduction to them over at https://t.co/cE2TYjcrdl.)
@epyllia I can try! First, they both involve "word vectors", which is a powerful way of encoding the associations between words. Basically it works by churning through a corpus, and then putting words that appear close to each in texts, close to each other in a ~300-dimensional space.

God bless the academic blogs of the 2000s &amp; early 2010s. Of huge help to me now are some brilliant Marxist blogs active then... but pretty much all of them are deserted now, in the era of social media. The public sphere of the last decade's internet is gone, it's been privatized.
Love this bit of dialectical romanticism from Marx's introduction to the Grundrisse: "A man cannot become a child again, or he becomes childish. But does he not find joy in the child‚Äôs na√Øvit√©, and must he himself not strive to  reproduce its truth at a higher stage?"

@_akpiper ya, i have a similar relationship to grep. i mainly use it if I want to quickly look at instances of a particular word in a collection of texts. but it's ridiculously, impossibly fast, which kinda scares me: it'll finish piping out thousands of examples before i've read even one.
@_akpiper grep is indeed scary! sublime even: these old unix programs feel to me like ancient artifacts from computation's classical antiquity. for this problem though, I think that the -w flag on grep will force it to find full words: grep -w word textfile

@jaheppler @broomgrass ya I love Altman's McCabe, such a beautiful mood-piece of a western. haven't seen Little Big Man but will check it out!
@broomgrass do you want it to be TV or is film ok too? favorite films: John Ford's Stagecoach, The Searchers, Man who shot Liberty Valance; Fred Zinnemann's High Noon; Howard Hawks' Red River; Sergio Leone's Man with No Name trilogy; Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch; and Eastwood's Unforgiven.
so, as a Westerns fan, i really wanted to like the Netflix miniseries "Godless," but it turned out to be a mere skeleton of tropes it didn't even seem to understand, and it undid its supposed feminism at every turn. sad!

@goldstoneandrew And DH poses a threat of casualization ("retraining," etc) that it defiitely needs to manage (by defending nec of TT). In terms of arguments for lit research, though: Can DH help reframe lit research as in fact more broadly the study of "written culture"? The "great unread", etc?
@goldstoneandrew thanks AG, these are good points, maybe even esp the last, since more broadly I'm really just wondering how DH can help fight the revolution (i.e. as you write, help organize a cross-rank coalition of academics against casualization of labor)

@dan_sinykin ya the $ Q is interesting. it's like google, $, and search results. the illegibility of algorithms confuses social/formal, prod/rec divides
@dan_sinykin ya i bet it's more the latter. the "customers who bought x also bought y" model. so.. more social than formal.. but a diff kind of 'social'?
@dan_sinykin in fact, the whole production/reception dichotomy feels so pre-digital. where does this human-algorithm interface fit into that model?
@dan_sinykin blunt sociological relation of "means of production" (mainstream/indie) is, ya, fractured into a bunch of illegible smaller associations
@dan_sinykin is that because it's formally different from my usual listening habits? or because people who listen to what I listen to don't listen to it?
@dan_sinykin imo yours is more nuanced. btw context: why does my DiscoverWeekly never have more mainstream stuff like this new awesome Demi Lovato album?

@Ted_Underwood Cool, I think that will have a big impact. DH canon now is mainly G,M,T and Macroan. partly because they're accessible book-length arguments
@Ted_Underwood I agree, though I think a lot of those internal debates are bound to be too arcane for folks. I think what we need are more DH monographs.
@Ted_Underwood "distant" reading did that work for a while, but implied an antagonism that the field is trying to get past. thus new theoretical confusion?
@Ted_Underwood ya, though I think most people don't even want to do it, so much as find a way to make its place within the discipline legible theoretically
@dan_sinykin hm, maybe. I actually think people are trying to befriend DH &amp; find a place for it in the disciplinary geography, but aren't quite sure how.
@dan_sinykin ya, def overdetermined. but I also feel like the discipline is getting over those critiques even as an unplaceable anxiety about it remains.

@goldstoneandrew I've also been *disaggregating* the net: dividing humans into quasi-Latourian actants, so that M[ary] Cooper the publisher != the bookseller https://t.co/Zu5OuvaEti
@goldstoneandrew also playing w/ "blockmodeling" the communities (https://t.co/xp7UPPWEc1), ie making each a node, w/ edges from orig net. But it's confusing https://t.co/vnvEUhKo7O
@goldstoneandrew The colors show net-community, which aggregate actors (though not by much). But does that approach a "position"? I seek the Bourdieu wisdom.
@Michael_A_Gavin CoreNLP ignores titles in its NER name-tagging, so right now Mr. X not in there since he has no first name. :-/
@Michael_A_Gavin i'm also ignoring names without first name or initial. do you have a sense of how often name ambiguity (of initial + surname) is a problem?
@Michael_A_Gavin @goldstoneandrew this I think can get congers? b/c each name in imprints like "printed for A. Wilde, J. Rivington, W. Johnston..." is target of "printed:for"
@Michael_A_Gavin @goldstoneandrew no, as for ambiguity I'm not doing anything yet. (eek! just started on this). I'm even abbreviating all "M[anything] Cooper" to "M. Cooper".
@Michael_A_Gavin @goldstoneandrew so I ran each imprint through https://t.co/10HSqJo0Qy, and then took all NER Persons that are the target of a "printed/pub'd/sold"+ "by/for"
@GrandjeanMartin Woops, ya it's actually text&lt;&gt;publisher&lt;&gt;author, so author gives pivot. Also, in these versions I'm including printers and booksellers, too.

@Ted_Underwood @hoytlong my only fear is that DH banishes hermeneutics, the "reading" of patterns into meaning. IMO it's an endangered but an important epistemology
@Ted_Underwood @hoytlong I like an ecumenical approach here: for some questions with good metadata, supervision is perfect; for other Qs, unsup patternseeking better
@Ted_Underwood @hoytlong Conversely tho?, the un-usefulness of supv modeling is it forces you to start from a small handful of categories (genre, gender, author, ..)
@Ted_Underwood i feel like youre doing an interesting critique of single 'herm. circle' &amp; arguing for range of 'hermeneutic paths' in DH depending on model
@Ted_Underwood but that's really interesting, and i think you're right, that certain kinds of patterns elicit different kinds of interpretive desires/acts
@Ted_Underwood true. still, i'd be curious what lit forms are driving differentiation (eg in your un/reviewed poetry article, neg affect words? so int'g!)
@Ted_Underwood at least, maybe? :) I rly appreciate your work theorizing un- vs. supervised models, and I'm always afraid I'm not understanding it right
@Ted_Underwood but we still need to engage in hermeneutics to interp that pattern as the product or "shadow" of an underlying social or literary form
@Ted_Underwood ie in FM's terms, if "patterns are the shadows of forms over data," then supv models can find patterns between interp'd objects (eg genre)..
@Ted_Underwood but interpreting the formal, literary, and social meaning of such facts still seems to me like a crucial hermeneutic exercise
@Ted_Underwood I know supervised models start w/ human interps of what novels count as Gothic, etc, and can then tell us quantitative things about them..
@Ted_Underwood Cool post! To me Fish was just a skeptic of all hermeneutics. My Q: isn't hermeneutic act still necessary at end of supervised modeling too?

@goldstoneandrew @RichardJeanSo i.e. to me essays liberate DR from being everything: it isn't lit sociology, and it isn't explanatory modeling. it's reading. and that's ok.
@goldstoneandrew @RichardJeanSo then, tho meant as critiques?, these contrasts show how intuition &amp; inference applied to data is a coherent &amp; viable crit method called "DR"
@goldstoneandrew If @RichardJeanSo contrasts DR's "intuition" with model-making, &amp; @goldstoneandrew its readerly "inferences" with sociological explanation..
i.e. I think @goldstoneandrew's point can be even stronger: Distant Reading isn't reading, just a heterodox one; it's now another orthodoxy.
Main impression: to me essays make clear how Distant Reading is now as coherent and accepted a methodology as New Historicism or BookHistory

@dasmiq @Ted_Underwood @broomgrass So true about semantics/discourse. Particularly when your model of semantics is the "distributional hypothesis", i.e. meaning = associations
@broomgrass @Ted_Underwood Overall model does still seem legit to me. That sermons fall and novels rise seems fundamental to period's discursive and semantic histories
@broomgrass @Ted_Underwood I like that, an overall model + genre models. More intuitive to think of semantic changes within a genre than how each genre affected them.

@ShlomoArgamon @Ted_Underwood @mjlavin80 @mesotronium @scott_bot @goldstoneandrew word2vec too seems to work well with bad OCR b/c it compresses bad &amp; good spellings into same low-dimens. vector space (tho shd test this) +

@mjlavin80 @Ted_Underwood @mesotronium @scott_bot @goldstoneandrew No, great idea! The errors that introduces might be differently distributed than OCR's typeset-based ones?, but still useful for modeling
@Ted_Underwood @mesotronium @scott_bot @goldstoneandrew Was just wondering this too. It might also have to do with letter frequency/proximity to likely OCR errors, too? Will try this out soon
@Ted_Underwood @mesotronium @scott_bot @goldstoneandrew This is a great idea. I might attempt this soon w/r/t word freqs in ECCO. e.g., normalizing by # recognized words doesn't seem to work? --&gt; https://t.co/phhYfu0ceJ
@Ted_Underwood @mesotronium @scott_bot @goldstoneandrew Tho given @dmimno's comment that it's *distribution* of OCR acc's that matters, could one plot word freqs for separate "bands" of OCR acc's?
@Ted_Underwood @mesotronium @scott_bot @goldstoneandrew But for doing good ol' word frequency plots, you would recommend limiting word counting to texts with &gt;90% OCR accuracy?
@Ted_Underwood @mesotronium @scott_bot @goldstoneandrew Yeah, I'm OCR-paranoid right now because my text-reuse stats were bonkers for bad OCR texts. Good to know supervised modeling more robust. +
@mesotronium @Ted_Underwood @scott_bot @goldstoneandrew Btw, I owe a big thank you to @Ted_Underwood, whose incredible OCR Normalizer (https://t.co/66ftFHrRPL) improved these texts' OCR by a lot!
@mesotronium @Ted_Underwood @scott_bot @goldstoneandrew I hope so? But I'm afraid that small differences across time might tilt any results. Here's ECCO: https://t.co/GwG3IV7SVw
@goldstoneandrew Here's a micro-experiment on how texts of different OCR qualities, vs. texts randomly perturbed by Nth letter, affects word frequency. https://t.co/nesTiWV5Lp
@goldstoneandrew I like that. I'll have to think more about how to calculate that and how it might make noisier texts still tractable, at least sometimes.
@goldstoneandrew anecdata: for 2 pairs of editions of Johnson's Dict, with ~85% vs. ~65% OCR accuracy, Jaccard similarity of 7-letter-grams is 0.49 vs. 0.08.
@goldstoneandrew that's int'g. ya, I'd like to know to what extent that and/or OCR errors are systematic (like longer words appearing to be less frequent)
@goldstoneandrew good idea. not sure how to perturb a text/simulate worsening OCR, but I'll try soon to re-run trend using different distribs. of OCR quality
for people working with noisy OCR text: what's the minimum OCR accuracy of text you'll deal with (for, say, word frequency data)?

@SethRudy first, en passant, why is there no stoner metal album called "Kingdom of Ends"?
@SethRudy ya, good point. maybe there is Enligh. inside #PostTruth: "Nullius in verba." except now it's applied to institutions of knowledge
@SethRudy #PostTruth truth feels more like Romantic truth, conviction, or American-pragmatist truth, "consensus"‚Äîof one's twitter followers
@SethRudy yep. but for some good reasons: intellectual conservatism of "Reason", etc. so, what's the Aufhebung of Enlightenment+#PostTruth?
@SethRudy I mean, Obama was arguably more Enlightenment than Jefferson. Plus: we 18C-ists just became cultural radicals. who knew? Vive! etc
@SethRudy lately, after Trump, #PostTruth, etc etc, it doesn't feel cool anymore to knock the Enlightenment. Truth! Reason! Liberty! = sexy

@kvanaren i'd still love to read it though! there *has* to be a venue for that. Reality TV + Richard III?
@kvanaren i.e. once you try to make plot, to rationalize the narrative into cause/effect, you escape Trump's orbit. you need pure character.
@kvanaren ^ why imo only Shakespeare(anism) can capture Trumpy melodrama. soliloquy + the zany + Richard III-ish sociopathic characterology.
@kvanaren imagine Alec Baldwin/Trump alongside Spacey and Robin Wright. he'd be a cartoon character, a Jessica Rabbit, a generic irruption.
@kvanaren i think the problem with political melodrama is that it's Ted Cruz based. evil ideologues. but what's scarier is evil 6 year olds.
@kvanaren makes me rethink lit-crit moments like "poetry completely changed after French Rev! -- wait, nah, that's too simple." BUT IS IT?

@Ted_Underwood @scott_bot @matthewdlincoln it's the "ELIZA effect": people love to attribute agency to computers! (come to my MLA talk!) :P
@Ted_Underwood @scott_bot @matthewdlincoln making us forget the 'impenetrability' between all literary data and real literary/cultural forms
@Ted_Underwood @scott_bot @matthewdlincoln in a way, word counts are *more* susceptible to an ethos of "factiness" through their simplicity
@Ted_Underwood @scott_bot @matthewdlincoln for unsupervised research designs. word2vec is "unsupervised" but can be used for human-guided ?s
@Ted_Underwood @scott_bot @matthewdlincoln i agree w the spirit of this thread, but i'm afraid unsupervised models are becoming a scapegoat+

@Ted_Underwood @yoavgo yeah, but (imo) at the cost of our capacity to interp what linguistic/literary/cultural forces explain the separation
@Ted_Underwood @yoavgo to me challenge is making interp at level of abstraction above the variability (eg 'neg affect words' over 'anguish')
@Ted_Underwood @yoavgo i agree, but isnt variability a prob for all DH interp? e.g. which words turned out significant for predictive model?

+ in sum, insofar as DH sees itself as reforming or purifying the humanities of "non-empirical" ways of thinking, then LARB may have a point
+ and, crucially, to me, that combination is less a blending than an epistemological interface that preserves the distinctness of its parts
+ to me, DH is not a science: its beauty lies in its interdisciplinary combination of scientific and humanistic methods and epistemologies
+ i also believe that it's important for DH to maintain a respect and an attachment with hermeneutic epistemologies and concerns
+ but, i also share a belief that DH, self-styled as an insurgent within "traditional" scholarship, might discard important ways of thinking
+ and I'm as offended as other DHers of being accused of neoliberalism‚Äîespecially, tbh, a day after I was arrested protesting neoliberalism
+ the accusation that DH is facilitating the neoliberal takeover of the university is a disturbing resurrection of culture-war paranoia...

@yoavgo @Michael_A_Gavin @IgorBrigadir @benmschmidt except maybe window size? but ya, why i'm often limiting analysis to same part of speech
@yoavgo @Michael_A_Gavin @IgorBrigadir @benmschmidt to me, "pet": those two words can function similarly in discourse, an added proximity
@Michael_A_Gavin @yoavgo @IgorBrigadir @benmschmidt i guess so: less syntagmatic/syntactic relationships and more substitutive/conceptual.
@benmschmidt @Michael_A_Gavin @yoavgo @IgorBrigadir cool idea! why not? would be nice to know ideal dist for, say, semantic/conceptual rels
@yoavgo @Michael_A_Gavin @IgorBrigadir @benmschmidt hm. better= improved semantic over syntactic relations, bc syntax boundaries contextual?
@yoavgo @Michael_A_Gavin @IgorBrigadir @benmschmidt instead of a list of 5-word skip-grams, a list of n-word clauses or phrases or sentences
